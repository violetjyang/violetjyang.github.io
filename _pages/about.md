I am a Clinical Research Coordinator at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai within the Department of Psychiatry and the Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health. I currently work under the supervision of Dr. Cheryl Corcoran at the [Language Lab](https://www.cuemountsinai.org/news) and Dr. Baihan Lin at the [Byte of Mind Lab](https://www.byteofmind.com/) where together we leverage natural language processing and other computational methods to study psychological phenomena in psychosis risk. In this role I coordinate the Mount Sinai site for the [Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Schizophrenia (AMP® SCZ)](https://www.ampscz.org/) — the largest international multi-site consortium dedicated to identifying biological, behavioral, and digital markers in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis.

My goal is to become a Computational Clinical Psychologist who uses dynamic systems theory to study the architectures of psychopathology. Through intensive longitudinal methods and mathematical simulations, I aim to map the transdiagnostic feedback loops between stress, affect, social behavior, and clinical symptoms, exploring how these interactive processes give rise to maladaptive states across conditions rather than relying solely on static diagnostic categories.

I am also drawn to theory building and the application of generative AI, particularly World Models and Vision Language Models, to deepen our understanding of qualitative experience. How can we quantify internal phenomenology and the human search for meaning? How do these dimensions relate to the self? By bridging computational tools with clinical science, I hope to better articulate the inner lives of individuals across the spectrums of psychosis, depression, and suicide.
